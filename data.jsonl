{"page_content": "Doctor of Philosophy (Management Sciences)\nAdmission Process    Application FormProgram OverviewThe PhD program provides high quality management education to business scholars i.e. to discover and impart culturally and globally relevant knowledge in management sciences. The program is designed to discover management scholarship which is intellectually rigorous, morally intensive, socially integrative, culturally relevant and globally acknowledged. PhD scholars will be encouraged to carry out original work through research which connects strongly with resolving local, national and global challenges of significance. PhD in Management is offered at Islamabad at Lahore Campus.The Islamabad Campus is currently offering PhD in the following areas of specialization: ManagementFinanceHuman Resource ManagementTechnology ManagementEligibilityA Master\u2019s degree in a relevant subject, earned from a recognized university after a minimum of 18 years of education with CGPA of at least 3.0/4.0 or equiva lent.A minimum of 60% marks and at least 50 percentile rank in the relevant NTS subject test. The NTS GAT-Subject Score should be valid at the time of admission.Selection CriteriaAdmission is based on a candidate\u2019s performance in the following:Performance in International GMAT or an equivalent test as per HEC ruleInterview and assessment by the Doctoral Admissions Committee (FSM DAC)Submission of Research Proposal (for the purpose of evaluation)Scheme of StudyThe PhD program requires candidates to take six graduate level courses (18 Cr. hrs.). There are four core courses, listed below. The remaining two can be taken from graduate level courses in the Faculty of Management Sciences or from the specialization electives for PhDs with the recommendation of the supervisor. On completion of the coursework, students are required to pass a qualifying comprehensive examination, defend their research proposal and then carry out research in the chosen area. The candidates are also required to publish research papers in journals of international repute, as per prevalent requirements.List of Core CoursesTitleCr. hrs.TitleCr. hrs.Philosophy of Management Science3Quantitative Methods in Management Research 3Research and Theory in Management3Qualitative Methods in Management Research3Note: Deficiency courses may be recommended by FSM-DAC for selected candidates on case to case basis.Outlines of Core Courses (These are broad guidelines only. Instructors may vary emphases on individual topics and themes and bring additional topics that they see fit)Philosophy of Management Science (MG601): It is said that management is governing and leading without recourse to political power or religious authority. This advanced level course will help students to realize and appreciate the nature of management field to a greater maturity and sophistication by interchangeably addressing the philosophical aspects of management and managerial aspects of philosophy. Accordingly, the process that will be used will start with, and put major focus on, developing an understanding of the evolution of management and organizational philosophy in a chronological order by classifying the work of central theorists and authors from a perspective that clarifies their relevance with the mainstream theory building in the field of management. The idea is to dissect the body of knowledge in management science \u2013 i.e., perspectives such as classical and neo-classical organization theory, OB perspective, structural organization theory, systems theory and organizational economics, power and politics, organizational culture and environment, and postmodernism, etc. \u2013 and interpret it as a continuous effort to analyzing, predicting, controlling and governing human action.Research and Theory in Management (MG604): A theory is said to be an ordered set of assertions about a generic set of behavior that hold true for a wide range of specific instances. But where do new theories come from? How theories are built starting from a very basic research question? And can theories be good or bad since once popularized they not only explain behavior but influence behavior in a certain direction. Finally, what constitutes a \u2018weak\u2019 or a \u2018strong\u2019 theory? The aim of this course is to develop a critical appreciation ofthe role of research in theory development in Management as well as introducing doctoral students to the art and science of theory construction and model building. Topics include examining the nature of being (ontology) and knowing (epistemology), exploring the basic structure of argument and evidence, developing a pertinent and interesting research question, defining constructs, imagining relationships and processes that link constructs, and linking and combining constructs in an innovative way to develop new theories or build further upon existing behavioral models. This course demands intensive preparation on part of students in terms of readings prior to the lectures so that lively discussions can be generated in the classroom, research exercises tailored to each student\u2019s research topic can be accomplished, and a term paper be completed.Qualitative Methods (MG 589): This course will introduce a range of qualitative research methods and the means of assessing the key assumptions underlying the selection and use these methods. Building on the fundamental questions about the nature of knowledge and whether \"true\" knowledge or reality can exist, the discussions will provide a deep understanding of the advantages and challenges in carrying out qualitative research. Examples of topics covered include interviews, focus groups, ethnography, documentary and textual analysis, discourse analysis, language and conversation analysis, case-studies, participatory action research and grounded theory. Categorization and coding of data will be covered in detail. The course will include labs to introduce software for qualitative data analysis. The course will also cover the growing significance of qualitative research techniques across the modern and postmodern era. Further, scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand various approaches to writing qualitative papers.Quantitative Methods (MG 548): This course will introduce a range of advance quantitative research technique and develop an understanding of the potential and limitations of statistical analysis. Building on the positivist paradigm, the course will briefly revise concepts of probability, sampling, hypothesis development, developing constructs, associations and basic analyses for differences between groups. Examples of main topics covered include various types of regression, discriminant analysis, MANOVA, analysis of covariance, principal component and factor analysis, cluster analysis, structural equation modelling, survival/failure analysis and time series analysis. The course will include labs to introduce software for quantitative data analysis. Scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand articles which have used a variety of quantitative methods, developing the capacity to choose advance techniques suitable for their research questions.\nMore Details", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.nu.edu.pk/", "title": "FAST National University", "language": "No language found."}}

Fee is non-refundable/adjustable.\n\nUpon payment of the Application Processing Fee (and additional Admission Test Fee), the applicant will print his/her ADMIT CARD bearing the applicant\u2019s TEST ROLL NUMBER.\nThe applicant should then visit the test campus on the specified date and time as mentioned on the Admit card.\n\nAdmission of a student automatically stands cancelled if he or she fails in the required exam whose result was not available at the time of admission.\n\nNU Online Admission Test for Graduate programs\n\n\r\n                            Information on various Admission Tests is available on the University\u2019s admission web-site\r\n                            \nadmissions.nu.edu.pk\n\n\nThe online admission test is taken on a computer. The candidate should be familiar with the use of mouse and the keyboard. Each candidate is given a different examination. The sections of a test (English, Analytical skills, Math etc) appear in a random sequence. Moreover, questions related to different topics also appear before the candidate in a random sequence. In each section, a candidate can move forward and backwards to review the responses selected. The candidate can change his or her response to any question within the current section.\nEach section of the admission test has a fixed duration. Each section is timed independently and time saved in one section is not carried forward to the next sections. At the end of the test, a summary of the results is displayed on screen. The duration of the Online Admission Test is between two and three hours.\nApplicants should reach the test centre on the date and time specified on the admit card. Latecomers will not be allowed to take the test. Applicants should not bring anything to the test centre except their Admit Cards. No applicant will be allowed to take the test without an endorsed Admit Card. The Admission Test is held at all campuses of the University (Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, and Peshawar).\nSelection Criteria\n\n\nClick Here\n for Selection Criteria.\r\n                        \n\nSelected Candidates Announcement\n\n\r\n                                    The selected candidates are informed through SMS on their cell phones and also via email.

For almost all courses, the semester work will contribute 50% towards the final grade, while the final examination will contribute the remaining 50% of the total marks. A letter grade will be awarded to each student based on his/her overall academic performance in a course.\n\n\nDescription of Grades\n\nThe Grade Point Average calculation ensures a continuous scale for the respective grades. The grade issued by the University will be final. Two types of averages will be computed for the grades obtained by each student, the Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) and the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). SGPA is the weighted average of grade points earned in a semester. The weights are taken as the ratio of course credits to the total credits taken by the student in the semester.\nSGPA is the weighted average of grade points earned in a semester. The weights are taken as the ratio of course credits to the total credits taken by the student in the semester.\nCGPA is the weighted average of all the courses taken so far. For repeat courses, only the most recent grade points are used, even if they are less than the earlier attempts.\nThe following points need to be noted:\n\"W\" will appear as a grade in the transcript like any other grade.\n\"I\" will appear as a temporary grade in the transcript subject to change to the grade awarded.

University aims to equip students to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The University expects its students to strive towards acquisition of attributes that befit the national objectives. These attributes, in turn, should be reflected in their everyday behaviour, attitude and dress.\nIn order to achieve these goals all students are obliged to strictly follow the Code of Conduct laid down below:\n\nStudents should refrain from conduct that might damage the reputation of the University. They must also avoid any conduct that may lead to the disruption of any academic program /activity of the Campus.\nStudents will show tolerance, understanding, and respect for the rights of others. In case of any misunderstanding with peers or University management, etc., discussions and exchange of views within the framework of decency and decorum would be the desirable course to follow. Threatening behaviour to fellow students, faculty, staff, or the University as an institution could cause irrevocable dismissal from the University.\nStudents will be respectful to members of the opposite gender and will refrain from any behaviour that can be interpreted by others as \u2018gender harassment\u2019.\n\r\n                Students are strictly reminded that gender mixing is permissible only within the accepted social and cultural norms of the society. Faculty tolerance should not be construed as an approval to undue intimacy or unacceptable proximity, openly or in isolated areas. Girls and boys are not allowed to sit next to each other in the classrooms, labs, and library or outside.\r\n                The expected cultural norm is as per the Ayat of Surah Nur (Ayat 30-31)\n\r\n                    \"Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and be modest. That is purer for them. Lo! Allah is aware of what they do.\u2019 \u2018And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and be modest, and to display of their adornment only that which is apparent, and to draw their veils over their bosoms.\" (Pickthal)\n\n\nIt is the responsibility of all to keep the Campus environment clean and tidy. Therefore, no littering or trash should be carelessly thrown or left on the Campus premises. The designated waste bins should be used for the purpose.\nThe students are advised to refrain from any damage to the University fixtures/furniture including Venetian blinds, scribbling/carving on desks, writing on walls, and misusing lab equipment, etc.\nSmoking is not allowed on campuses. Anyone found smoking has to pay a fine.\nStudents are advised to switch off mobiles in classrooms, examination halls, labs and library so as not to disrupt the calm of the said places.\nStudents are advised to strictly follow the code of conduct on-the-field and off-the-field while taking part in sports and other extra-curricular activities. Students are expected to exhibit exemplary behaviour, especially while representing the University in an activity/competition.\nMatters of indiscipline would be referred to the Campus Discipline Committee, which is authorized to reprimand or check any indiscipline. Parents of students who disobey authority and violate the code of conduct will be called to the university. Disciplinary Committee may suggest action to be taken for breaching code of conduct by the student.\nStudents must refrain from cheating, plagiarism, lying, stealing, and gender harassment, in any setting of the Campus.\n\n\nDress Code\n\nThe students of the University are expected to dress keeping in view the local cultural values.\n\nThe students are not allowed to wear shorts or sleeveless shirts. The dress should not have any scripts or images, which appear to be provocative or indecent.\nThe students should not wear tight or see-through clothes.\nThe students are not expected to put on heavy make-up or expensive jewellery.\nClothes with photograph of any celebrity/political personality/or with unethical printed words are strictly not allowed.\nClothes should not pretend any influence towards any political or religious party.\n\n\nCheating encompasses the following\n\n\nThe wilful giving or receiving of an unauthorized, unfair, dishonest, or unscrupulous advantage in academic work over other students.\nThe above may be accomplished by any means whatsoever, including but not limited to the following: fraud; duress; deception; theft; trick; talking; signs; gestures; copying from another student; and the unauthorized use of study aids, memoranda, books, data, or other information.\nAttempted cheating.\nCalling proxy attendance.\n\n\nPlagiarism encompasses the following\n\n\nPresenting as one's own the words, the work, or the opinions of someone else without proper acknowledgment. (This includes material published on the Internet)\nBorrowing the sequence of ideas, the arrangement of material, or the pattern of thought of someone else without proper acknowledgment.\n\n\nStealing encompasses the following\n\nTaking or appropriating without the permission to do so, and with the intent to keep or to wrongfully use the property belonging to any member of the campus or any property located on the university campus. This includes but is not limited to misuse of university computer and other lab resources.\n\nLying encompasses the following", "metadata": {"source": "https://nu.edu.pk/Student/Conduct", "title": "Code of Conduct", "language": "No language found."}}
